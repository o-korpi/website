The idea I had was to have a sort of build tool that uses yaml for its configuration. I think it's a great format for this purpose. I initially wanted to write a complete build system on my own. But there isn't really anything wrong with how Gradle or Maven builds projects. Their main issues are:<br>
- Verbosity, in the case of Maven<br>
- Overcomplicated and buggy, in the case of Gradle
<br>
<br>
And so I had the idea to write a program that parses the yaml configuration file and generates a maven file for you. The result is fairly simple. A basic configuration file, generated by the program as a starting point, looks like this:
            </p>
            <code>
project:
  name: myProject
  group: com.example
  version: 0.0.1

  kotlinVersion: 2.0.0
  jvmTarget: 1.8  # Valid values: 1.8, 9, 10, ..., 21. Default 1.8
  mainClass: "com.example.myProject.MainKt"
  versions:

  plugins:

  dependencies:

  testDependencies:

            </code>

            <p>
                Everything is fairly explicit here, and you can easily see how your project is configured with just a glance.
<br><br>
The yaml to Maven converter ended up working fairly well, but it doesn't solve all our issues. Adding the converter adds another step that the user has to go through to compile their program, and what if we want to add some more complicated logic to our build process?
<br><br>
The solution here is to add a tool called Taskfile. Taskfile allows us to define tasks to be run simple configuration file. By having our tool automatically generate a taskfile for us, we can do all our build commands through the tasks. The taskfile happens to use yaml as well, making it consistent with our build config. And finally, since the taskfile is human readable and editable by the user, it is very easy to see what's going on, and you can easily make your own changes to modify the build process or add more steps.
